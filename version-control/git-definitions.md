# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful? (Version control is 'the management of changes to documents'. It is useful to maintain, track and sandbox changes to a master document until changes are merged with master document.)

* What is a branch and why would you use one? (A branch is a unit of code selected from a master for editing purposes. It is sandboxed from the master and all other branch's. It is used as a sandboxed trial of code that can be changed while not affecting the master or other branch's. Ultimately it is merged with the master branch.)

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? (A commit is a method of adding a branch to a master project. A good commit message is detailed and concise in describing what changes have been made to that branch.)

* What is a merge conflict? (Merge conflict is a failure of a merge for several reasons.)
